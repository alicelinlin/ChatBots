						<h2><a name="_Toc69739712"></a>RISK OVERVIEW INSUFFICIENT DOMAIN KNOWLEDGE – MEDICAL, LEGAL, AND TECHNICAL</h2>
            <p>Marc Valpiani</p>
            <p>A major risk to our project is the sheer complexity of the problem our product addresses. To successfully launch our product, a range of technical, medical, and legal skills are required. While our team may make some progress towards releasing our product, as first-semester IT students, we are likely to quickly come up against the limits of our knowledge in generating any useful technology product.  </p>
            <p>As our proposed product is a COVID 19 information chatbot, extensive medical and legal knowledge would be required to ensure that the information used to train the chatbot is correct. Medical knowledge is also required during the testing phase to ensure the bot gives safe and useful recommendations. As none of our team members have any medical training, we will need to rely on readily available information on the internet to train our chatbot. </p>
            <p>To minimize the risk of training our bot with poor information, our team will use the information provided by government health departments.  </p>
            <h3>LEGAL KNOWLEDGE IS REQUIRED TO UNDERSTAND THE CONSEQUENCE OF GIVING HEALTH ADVICE.  </h3>
            <p>As first-year students, our team members would generally have less than six months of programming experience, and the complexity of our projects in this subject and introductory programming subjects has been creating simple websites or creating small utility programs using Java.  </p>
            <p>Creating a useful tech product in a commercial setting is generally undertaken by teams of highly trained professionals. For example, large tech companies have thousands of employees and recruit highly trained graduates and researchers.  </p>
            <h3>LIABILITY</h3>
            <p>Providing health advice opens a company or individual to the chance of legal liability if incorrect advice is given and a user suffers harm because of acting on that advice. Furthermore, as an internet service, it will be accessible to users in different countries, subject to different laws relating to health advice.  </p>
            <p>To minimise the potential for legal action against our company, we would need to provide disclaimers relating to the use of our product. Users should be informed that suggestions generated by the chatbot are informational only and do not replace the advice of a trained health professional.  </p>
            <p>Users should be reminded to check with their local health authorities and consult a medical professional.  </p>
            
            
            <h3>CHANCE OF PROVIDING INCORRECT INFORMATION  </h3>
            <p> As Covid-19 information chatbot, our product is required to give appropriate advice to users based on self-reported descriptions of their symptoms. Without proper controls and necessary caution, there is the risk that our product would give incorrect advice to a user, which may, in turn, have considerable public health consequences.  </p>
            <p>Also, as Covid 19 is a global pandemic, the situation is constantly changing and may vary between countries and regions. Different governments may have different policies in place and offer different health advice to their citizens.  </p>
            <p>As an internet tool that may be accessed across different times and places, there is a chance that if it offers generic information that what may be good advice in one country may not be in another. These differences may occur for several reasons, such as current daily cases in a particular country or the level of a country's health infrastructure, which is likely to vary significantly between developed and developing countries</p>
            <p>To mitigate the risk of providing incorrect or outdated information, the service would need to be constantly updated after its release to meet current standards and guidelines. </p>
            <h3>COMPETITION RISK</ph3>
            <p>This is already a competitive area; the competition is well advanced into the technology. There are already many medical Chatbots available. They can handle a range of medical queries. The Chatbot Services can supply medical diagnosis, recommendations and refer your details to a doctor for patient admission.    </p>
            <p>However, many products have also been and gone; many have failed initially. These products were premature and underdeveloped. This has left the market at an opportune moment in history, an edge. By the look of the competition, this will be short-lived. The time is now.    </p>
            <p>Previous failures have created a moment of uncertainty in the market. The technology, in the eyes of the market is, is a ‘Fad’ and will fade. But as we know, this is no Fad.   </p>
         
            <p>The market already contains many specialized Chatbots for dealing with medical queries.</p> 
            <p><a href="https://medicalfuturist.com/top-12-health-chatbots/ ">https://medicalfuturist.com/top-12-health-chatbots/ </a></p>
            
            <p>Each product is specific to handling a particular kind of medical service. Our Chatbot Covid 19 Service can fit in nicely here.</p>
            <p>Even if, we simple provide a FAQs service only, nobody specifically handles Covid 19 queries as a generic service. We can address this temporary gap in the market.  : </p>

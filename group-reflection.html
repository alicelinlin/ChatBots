							<h2>Group Reflection</h2>

						</header>

						<h2><a name="_Toc69739736"></a>Justin Healy</h2>
						<p>What our group has done well so far has been our ability to stick to our deadlines. During
							our meetings we have specified which work was needed to be completed and when. So far, we
							have all stuck to these deadlines and have been able to offer our pieces of work to the
							group for absorption into the collective.</p>
						<p>What could be improved in our team, is our ability to schedule meetings. Most of our meetings
							have been organised the day of, or the day before. We could improve by having a more
							structured meeting system.</p>
						<p>The thing that has surprised me about this experience is the same thing I have I learnt. It
							is that it takes time to settle into a groove with a group, even when all communication is
							online. I expected this part to be much easier as an online experience, but it is
							essentially how it would be if we were physically in a classroom together. We all had to
							find our way of contributing our parts and find our place in the team.</p>
						<p>In the way we structured GitHub, we used teams to host and edit all our sections, then when
							completed, these could be pushed to GitHub for web hosting.</p>
						<h2><a name="_Toc69739737"></a>James Stathakis</h2>
						<p>For Group #14, Assessment task 2, the group was amazing. Everyone in the group was kind and
							supportive, and there wasn&rsquo;t a single malicious or hostile member of the group. The
							group came together and welcomed each member of the group extremely well and the group
							divided up the workpretty well. However, from personal experience in the group, I
							didn&rsquo;t do much, if any. The work I was assigned, I was doing the IT work interviews,
							however, instead of interviewing an IT Professional personally, I took various interviews of
							different kinds of IT Professionals over the last 20 odd years and was going to compare
							them. I was doing relatively well in this when a group member reached out in the group
							stating he&rsquo;d done the interview. After a few days of lack of communication on my part
							to the rest of the group, I returned to see that the group was ready to cut me out of the
							Assessment.There&rsquo;reno hard feelings towards this, I had done little to the
							group. However, upon my return, there was a conscious effort on the group&rsquo;s part to
							include me back into the group, and tohelp outwith anything to get my
							contribution up, which was surprising, and comforting. I&rsquo;m not a very sociable
							individual, but to find such a warm and welcoming group of people for this assessment, was
							good.</p>
						<p></p>
						<h2><a name="_Toc69739738"></a>Alice w lin</h2>
						<p>In general, I enjoy group work, and although a lot of unexpected events occurred with missing
							team members, and us unable to have meetings according to everyone&rsquo;s time schedules
							etc.; it was still very enjoyable. The great thing about teamwork is that you can share your
							ideas, your questions, and your concerns with what you are doing with the others in the
							team, ultimately working together to achieve a common goal, that is to finish the assignment
							as best as we can!</p>
						<p>Another aspect I think our team did very well is that we split the sections among each member
							in the start very carefully before we started doing anything. From my experience, no matter
							if this is related work or study, it is important to trust your team, and you must assign
							each section properly to avoid unnecessary disagreements. We tried our best at assigning the
							sections equally, although it didn&rsquo;t really work as we intended, and there are some
							that might have done more work than others, there was no conflict. I think Everyone
							tried very hard, and everyone in our team is extremely bright and hardworking,
							everyone&rsquo;s got their own ideas and opinions, everyone had their skills to share with
							everyone else, making this experience particular enjoyable. Overall, the general experience
							for assignment 2 is very well enjoyed, and I would do another assignment with everyone in no
							time.</p>

						<p><i>What went well</i></p>
						<p>The group dynamic was very friendly and team members completed tasks on time at a good standard.
							Meetings were quite productive and didnâ€™t drag on unnecessarily.</p>
						<p><i>What could be improved</i></p>
						<p>We faced a few challenges with group formation and settling in to the assignment. One of our original
							group members ended up not responding and we had some difficulty assigning tasks as we did not know
							how many people we should split our work between. This was somewhat out of our control though, but
							it might have been a good idea to confirm at the very beginning whether group members were planning
							to stay enrolled in the course.  </p>
						<p>The main thing that could have been improved is planning meetings further in advance. We had to cancel a
							few meetings at the last minute because we could not get everyone online at the same time. I
							do not think this was anyone's fault personally, more a result of a group with different
							schedules trying to collaborate on a project.  </p>
						<p><i>One thing I learned about groups</i></p>
						<p>While this is fairly self evident, this assignment reinforced the idea that people have vastly different interests,
							strengths and skill sets. For example, when dividing the workload in our group it was interesting to note
							that each group member had different ideas about which sections that they wanted to work on. For example,
							one of our group members has very strong presentation skills, an area where I lack interest and skill,
							whereas I enjoy researching and writing and was inclined to work on the technology reports.</p>

						<h2><a name="_Toc69739739"></a>John Hurst</h2>
						<p>Before I start, it is prudent that you know I have worked in a variety of Programming Development teams in the past.</p>
						<p>Overall the group proceeded well into the assignment straight away. I think, this particular group of individuals were already equiped with an intrinsic will to succeed. Although, I guess that is already a given expectation, being that we have all enrolled in University for a specific purpose.</p>
						<p>Personally, I have enjoyed the experience. Interactions with such individuals has provided me with a little extra drive. The expectations are high, given the skill sets of each person. After sharing our, 'Assignment One', marks I knew I was in for a hard time if we were ever to compete. This, reality check, for each person forced output worthy of University level expectations.</p>
						<p>Each of us has a very good understanding of ourselves and as a result quickly assumed ownership of the individual tasks required. Each person understood what they were best at and took on that specifc role and task.</p>
						<p>Having said all of the above, from experience, I know that when a team operates in such an efficient manner there are usually some hidden, under the surface problems, that we have not yet addressed.</p>
						<p>I say this only, for I think there were a few operational processes that we need to work on. They all stem around communication. I myself am not isolated from this peice of constructive criticism either.</p>
						<p>Above all, I think we performed well together, which has me a little worried if things do not work well in the future.</p>
						<p>Groups don't don't always get along. There are occasions when we all become agitated or annoyed with others, I find when giving yourself a little time away comes understanding. Some of the perceived big issues are not a concern. So, in a couple of words patience comes understanding.</p>

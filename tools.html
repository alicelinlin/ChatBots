							<h2>Tools and Platform</h2>
						</header>
						<h3>The Webpage</h3>
						<br>
						<p>The first group website was established at the beginning of the assignment. However, this was not used. Myself (John), and Justin were the only two to have completed our work and commited any contend to this page.</p>
						<p><a href="https://github.com/s3882857/stunning-inspiration" target="_blank">https://github.com/s3882857/stunning-inspiration</a></p>
						<p>The eventual website was initiated within the final week of the assignment due date. The majority of the commits were performed by one person. A few alterations were conducted by one or two others after reviewing the work. Minor tweaks, and readding inadvertantly missed content etc. This does not accurately represent the work load split of the group.</p>

							<h3>GROUP PROCESSES AND COMMUNICATION TOOLS</h3>
						</header>
						
						<h3>Microsoft Teams</h3>
						<br>
						<p>To better coordinate communication as a group, we used Microsoft Teams. This digital communication tool allowed us to work and operate remotely, collaborate, and communicate more effectively while keeping our projects' productivity and collaboration effectiveness high.  </p>
						<p>By utilizing this platform, we were able to</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Conduct a weekly desktop video meeting in which we recorded the meeting. </li>
							<li>Conduct direct messaging as a group or in private.</li>
							<li>Simultaneously working on the same document with its cloud file sharing and editing feature, effectively updating each other on the assignment progress  </li>
							<li>Task management in the add task section </li>
							<li>Scheduling with its calendars</li>
						</ul>
						<p>As far as the platform of teams is concerned, the implementation met our needs for these assignments, and we definitely will be using teams in future assignments as the project gets underway. </p>
						<h2>Meetings</h2>

						<h3>GitHub</h3>
						<p>Due to the nature of our project, instead of being able to work on the codes on GitHub, we had to dedicate most of our time on building the prototypes on bot platforms like Microsoft Azure bot and Dialogflow. However, during both assignment 2 and 3 we used GitHub as a platform to host our website and collaboratively work on anything related with code. </p>
						<p>Aside from the fact that we were required to used GitHub by the assignment specification it was useful to our group project in several ways. Firstly, it allowed us to simultaneously work on the same code base, removing the need to continuously save and upload our work.</p>
						<p>Secondly, it provided a secure storage and backup for our code, allowing us to have a shared repository that store our work safely on GitHub’s servers which are likely to be significantly more fault tolerant than our own local storage. Thirdly it gave us a means to host our website through GitHub pages.</p>
			
						<p>Overall, GitHub enabled us to keep track of our work, commit changes to the repository, easily explore changes made, store our files, and automatically update our workstations with data from the repository. In the future, I believe we will be able to use GitHub more effectively as our coding skills improve. </p>

							<h2>PLATFORMS AND TOOLS USED TO BUILD OUR PRODUCT</h2>
						</header>
						<h3>Prototype Using Microsoft Azure</h3>
						<p>By Justin Healy</p>
						<br>
						<p>Prototype URL: <a href="https://young-reef-90350.herokuapp.com/">https://young-reef-90350.herokuapp.com/</a></p>
						<p>GitHub URL: <a href="https://github.com/S3886040/ChatBot ">https://github.com/S3886040/ChatBot</a></p>
						
						<ul>
							<li>Atom was used along with Microsoft Azure to develop the prototype for this assignment. </li>
							<li>Axios was used for the API requests on both the Front-end code, and server-side API calls. This is a great service. It makes API calls a much simpler process. It is a promise-based framework that is compatible with nearly all modern browsers. This is a significant advantage, as JavaScript has a native equivalent in the "fetch()" function. However, when we use it, we did run into compatibility issues. Particularly with older safari and internet explorer browsers. Despite the fact that this is only a prototype, the goal was to create a basic functional chat bot with scalability for future development. This is permitted by Axios.In terms of code, I used JavaScript, CSS and HTML to build the prototype. </li>
							<li>In creating the above prototype, we used Microsoft Azure as the Engine, making use of their Cognitive services and QNA maker API. As well JavaScript, HTML, CSS in the front end and NodeJS to program a basic server. </li>
						</ul>
						<p>We also took advantage of the cognitive service provided by Microsoft Azure to develop the prototype. The Microsoft Azure platform is difficult to use and very non-user friendly. But can be powerful when used correctly. The service used for the prototype was the QnA Maker API. </p>
						<p>This is an interesting service from Microsoft as they make it possible to create a specific knowledge base from which business can use for customer enquiries. We used this service in order to create a Covid QnA Bot. </p>
						<p>What it essentially does is allows the user to create an app from QnA maker portal then it creates an API from Microsoft's other services to serve as a QnA. Once you create a knowledge base with your custom FAQ, Azure will publish the service and give you an API address to call to. But what it does under the hood is compile a search service, an App Service, a cognitive service and a resource group. Then it uses all these when the QnA API is called to generate a response for the user. </p
						
						
						<p>Through the process of building the prototype the idea was to build something with a simple yet with scalable infrastructure to allow for future development. By having a backend this allows us to keep our API tokens secret and hide the logic from the end user. But the server is easily scalable by adding features to increase the Intelligence of the Bot. At the moment, the Bot receives a message from the user then send this message directly to the Microsoft API to be understood and generate a relevant response.</p>
						<p>But further to this we could add some logic to the user’s question to decide whether the Microsoft API needs to be consulted. For example, we could store some questionand-answer combos for basic questions in the back end for quick use and consult the API for more complex questions.</p>
						<p>My hope for this would be to one day phase out the use of any Intelligence framework and have a completely self-sustainable Machine learning and AI program to interact with our users without the added cost of external Frameworks. </p>
					
						<h6>The flow of the App runs like so: </h6>
						<ul>
							<li>The user clicks on the Bot Icon. </li>
							<li>JavaScript is then used to render the chat window.  </li>
							<li>The user can then type a message and hit the send button. </li>
							<li>The user’s message is then rendered in the chat window using JavaScript. </li>
							<li>The message is then sent to the backend using Axios(API HTTP client for sending API requests) </li>
							<li>The backend will then send the users question to Microsoft Azure. </li>
							<li>A response is received from Microsoft Azure and sent back to the front end. </li>
							<li>The front End then renders the response in the chat window. </li>
							<p>And the process can continue like this indefinitely. </p>
							
						
						</ul>

						<h3>Prototype Using Microsoft Azure</h3>

						<p>Git Hub Repository<a href="https://github.com/s3882857/ChatBotExperiment">https://github.com/s3882857/ChatBotExperiment</a></p>
						<p>This is not a fully working Endpoint yet. It is meant as a proof of concept. All three projects will run on a local machine. Two of which connect to the MS Azure AI Chatbot service. This is based on the QnA cognitive service. </p>
						
						<h6>Tools</h6>
						<p>The first project Chatbot.java is an all-in-one conversation between the console and the MZ Aure Chatbot. It sends a POST request and interprets the response, displaying it to the user. Console driven only. </p>
						<ul>
							<li>Eclipse </li>
							<li>Java </li>
							<li>JSON external libraries </li>
							<li>Maven </li>
						</ul>
						<p>The Second project ChatBotCovid19Service.java is more of a service which utilizes the spring boot libraries. This runs within apache tomcat on a local PC within eclipse. </p>
						<ul>
							<li>Eclipse </li>
							<li>Java </li>
							<li>JSON external libraries </li>
							<li>Maven </li>
							
							<li>Spring boot libraries </li>
							<li>Webservice is based on REST Architecture. </li>
							<li>Apache tomcat (Although I did not have to know much about this. Spring starts it for you) </li>
							
						</ul>
						<p>The third project is a testing interface which uses a console interface within eclipse to communicate with the above service. </p>
						<p>Investigated usage of Maven for Java projects within Eclipse. Installed and utilized within my projects. 
							Installed spring plugin into Eclipse. This led to more success in developing a Webservice in Java. Also required for a REST service 
							</p>
						<p>Installed JSON libraries into Eclipse. Used within Chatbot demo services. 
						The Microsoft procedures for building a Webservice in Java I found unhelpful, too complicated for a beginning project. However, I did spend a lot of time investigating to no avail. 
						</p>
						<p>This is a collection of Java based console programs. They are Eclipse projects. Please visit the repositories help file for further details. </p>

						<h3>DialogFlow for building conversational AI ChatBot </h3>
						<p>Prototype 3 by Alice W Lin & Reane Nadina Sutoyo </p>

						<br>
						<p>Dialogflow is another platform we explored to create our COVID-19 Chatbot. It is a natural language understanding platform that simplifies the process of designing and integrating a conversational user interface into possible mobile applications, our GitHub website, social media platforms such as Facebook, IoTs such as google assistant, etc. As well as incorporating our own branding and customize User Interface according to our design. </p>
						<p>By utilizing Dialogflow, we are able can provide users engaging interactions with our Covid-19 ChatBot. Dialogflow is capable of understanding a variety of forms of customer input, including text and audio (like from a phone or voice recording). 
						Additionally, it can also respond to our users in a variety of ways, including voice, text, or synthetic speech.  
						</p>
						<p>We used Dialogflow Trial edition v2 API  to create this chatbot, which provides most of the features of Dialogflow ES with limited quota and support from community and email (Google) but will upgrade to the ES version (which does need licensing and cost) once we are ready to put the product on the market. We will use ES instead of Dialogflow CX since it is a newer version of Dialogflow there is still a lot of missing features that are not yet available, and according to most Dialogflow tutorials ES is a lot easier to use than CX.  </p>
						<p>The tutorials on Google's website are extremely comprehensive, and with an easy-to-use console, you can easily design your chatbot with your own logic and integrate external modules. The simplified user interface design, uncomplicated, uncluttered design, complete control over the user experience in terms of context preservation and handling more complex queries, via machine learning and True Natural Language processing. </p>
						<p> We were able to completely programme and populate data from our databases directly on the console or through the use of thirdparty softwares. Despite the fact that none of us had much experience with coding, the interface was simple to use for non-developers.  </p>
						<p>Additionally, the beginner trial kit includes all the features of Dialogflow ES, with limited quota and support by community and email, which was perfect for us who are experimenting with Dialogflow.</p>
						<p>As for integrations, the platform is really easy to integrate to our GitHub website, social media platforms such as Facebook, IoTs such as google assistant, the list pretty much covers every area you could think of if we had additional time.</p>
					
						<p>With Google Cloud Platform as its backend, it can scale to an infinite number of users if we ever want to take this technology global. Additionally, with its numerous supported languages, scaling this project is a breeze.  </p>
						<p>In comparison to Microsoft Azure, which we also examined for ease of use, integration options, language support, and pricing. Taking all of these factors into account, Dialogflow was unquestionably the more preferred platform. </p>
						<p>A disadvantage,  that we did find was the dialog management section, which is somewhat based on rules that we give to the chatbot, it would be much better if the dialogue interface can block matching of certain intent if a context is present , we had to add manually if the output and input context is relevant to the conversation. </p>
						<h3>AWS chatbot services RASA </h3>
						<p>We Investigated AWS chatbot services RASA as potential alternative AI Cognitive QnA Service.  
						Compared with Dialogflow Rasa is an open-source machine learning tool that enables professional developers to buildt heir chatbots and enables more complex responses to various questions. </p>
						<p>This is a great tool in general, however we found it more complicated and suitable for developers who want more flexibility when it comes to chatbot responses and requires extended technical knowledge in order to use the platform. </p>
						<p>The codes are also completely open source, which is great if we want to use with GitHub, but also requires to install multiple software components to use the software such as anaconda. </p>
						<p>The platform is also limited in terms of out of the box integrations, which would potentially make integrating the chatbot more complicated during the development process.  </p>

						<p>What does it do? (600 words) What is the state of the art of this new technology? What can be
							done now? What is likely to be able to do be done soon (say in the next 3 years)? What
							technological or other developments make this possible? </p>
						<h2><a name="_Toc69739723"></a>Clouds, Servers, Services: </h2>
						<p>By Justin Healy </p>
						<p>Cloud computing can be defined as renting computing services on demand. Whether that be
							storage, data base structures, online IT infrastructure or whole software solutions provided
							to a client. And it is offered as a pay as you go service (Ranger, S 2018,
							Microsoft Azure). Cloud computing as a service has grown significantly in recent years, and
							now stands for more than a third of all IT spending (Ranger, S 2018). Cloud
							computing certainly is having and will have a profound effect on the world of
							computing in times to come. </p>
						<p>The essence of cloud computing can be broken down into its three main categories.
							Infrastructure as a service, Platform as a service and Software as a service. Infrastructure
							as a service offers businesses the building blocks of computing essential for a business.
							Namely servers and networking. Eliminating the need for businesses to invest in
							costly hardware and maintenance of physical on-site infrastructure. This approach can also
							make it easy for seasonal expansion as the business will simply need to pay for what they
							use, without needing to pay costs year-round for on-site Infrastructure. It
							also reduces the staffing costs that would have been needed if employers
							needed to support this on-site hardware. </p>
						<p>Platform as a service offers clients everything Infrastructure as a service offers, however
							with some added features like Operating System capability, development tools, business
							intelligence tools and data base management systems. Platforms are used primarily by
							developers and development teams to build, test, and implement applications. The advantage
							of using this platform is to decrease the amount of time and effort coding and developing
							structures that are now available. Some providers even offer pre coded components that can
							be incorporated existing. Some examples of these components would be the use of search
							boxes, security features and databases (Microsoft Azure PaaS). </p>
						<p>And finally, Software as a service offers clients a finished product ready to use for
							personal, business, or educational use. These applications are ready and connected to the
							cloud and offer everything cloud technology can offer. A great example of this would be
							Microsoft&rsquo;s Office suite. Allowing users to store and create word documents,
							PowerPoint presentations and spreadsheets then save directly to their OneDrive account
							located in the cloud. This program can also be directly accessed via a web browser by logged
							in users. All computation and processing are then executed by the web browsers and remote
							servers hosted by Microsoft. </p>
						<p>Although as businesses hand over such large pieces of infrastructure to outside companies.
							Security will undoubtably become a larger issue. One such issue is a potential weakness in
							The Virtualization Machines. Virtualization allows multiple users access
							to one single machine, known as the host machine. In between the VM (Virtual Machine)
							there is software known widely as the Hypervisor. The Hypervisor distributes the resources
							of the host machine to how ever many VM&rsquo;s are connected, spreading the resources
							as needed (Tsai et al., 2012, p. 32). However, Tsai et al highlight a potential floor
							within this framework known as VM hopping. An attacker could reach some access to
							other users using the same Host machine on alternate VM&rsquo;s. The confidentiality could
							be compromised as the attacker can monitor the victim&rsquo;s
							usage, change the VM configurations, and access and delete stored data.
							This undermines the security of the VM in a very comprehensive way. Although for this attack
							to occur, both Virtual Machines would have to be connected to the same Host Machine and the
							alternate VM&rsquo;s IP address must be known to the attacker. Why is this
							a noteworthy threat? Because many different VM&rsquo;s run attached to a Host
							Machine simultaneously, and if IP confidentiality of these VM&rsquo;s is compromised then VM
							hopping could potentially give attackers an exceptionally large opportunity to
							exploit the users in a damaging way (Tsai et al., 2012, p. 32). </p>
						<p>So, what is to come for the Cloud market? Growth. Since the Covid-19 Epidemic
							businesses have seen a larger share of the work force working from home and cloud-based
							technology offers a simple solution to help this change. And although the Covid-19
							epidemic will not be here forever. Working from home for a large share of workers looks to
							be a reality of the work force moving forward into the future. The global public cloud
							Infrastructure is set to grow 35 percent in 2021 with a major contributor being from the
							pandemic. And the global percentage of IT expenditure is tipped to grow 18 percent by the
							end of 2021. Again, facilitated by the workforces need for
							scalable infrastructure (Goodison, D 2020). </p>
						<p>For me personally, the cloud revolution will have an impact on my virtual life. Although I do
							not exclusively rely on any one cloud provider. I have different accounts for different
							data. I have more important documents and photos backed up in Microsoft&rsquo;s OneDrive
							cloud, as well as my all-University related files and Assignments backed up in
							a separate student OneDrive account. I also use Google Drive to back up some files
							against my Gmail account. The reason for my google drive account, is simple. It is
							compatibility. Google drive is much more compatible with android phones and chrome than
							OneDrive is. And perhaps this is where the cloud-based loyalties for most people will end
							up. Their choice of mobile phone, Laptop or smart device will ultimately decide which
							cloud-based service is used. </p>
						<p>Cloud based technology will increase its presence in my life as I continue to study from
							home. Using SaaS technology (Software as a service) in Canvas, RMIT&rsquo;s online
							learning tool. Microsoft&rsquo;s office suite in which all academic work will be drafted,
							perfected and published. And using Atom (a widely used code editor published by Git
							Hub) to code test and develop different programming projects required by my
							studies. </p>
						<p>As these cloud-based services develop, we may see a fourth or fifth dimension added to
							cloud-based providers ability. Perhaps a 3D development machine will be added, and it will
							be called 3D as a service. Regardless of the purpose of development in cloud technology, it
							will continue to create employment for IT professionals. The industry will grow to
							create more and physical cloud locations. Which in turn will create jobs for construction
							and Infrastructure divisions. As well as IT professionals to create the technology and
							maintain these locations. </p>
						<p>In conclusion, we find that Cloud services, although already well established, will continue
							to see growth in this technology as businesses continue to outsource part, if not
							all, of their IT Infrastructures to Cloud giants like Google and Microsoft. And
							with this growth I hope to see further innovation and development of the services and
							security they provide. </p>

						<h2><a name="_Toc69739724"></a>Raspberry Pis, Arduinos, Makey Makeys and other small computing
							devices: </h2>
						<p>By Justin Healy </p>
						<p>In our new world of the &lsquo;Internet of Things&rsquo;, we have seen the rise of small,
							completely programmable, home computing devices. With these devices we can create new home
							modern conveniences, create and develop new technologies, redesign old ones and educate the
							youth to the wonders of hardware and software design. The most popular among these home
							computing devices are the Raspberry Pi, The Arduino and Makey Makeys. There are other makes
							of devices but for the purposes of this essay we will concentrate on these three
							creations. </p>
						<p>Before we delve into the devices themselves, we should first have an understanding
							of the purpose of their existence. That purpose is their place in the world of the
							&lsquo;Internet of things&rsquo;(IOT). Modern households are awash with computing devices.
							From washing machines, fridges, home security systems, Tv&rsquo;s, bathrooms and even
							toilets being made capable of being fitted with some sort of computing device which make
							decisions based on behavior. This behavior may be the pressing of a button,
							closing of a door or simply walking into a room. However, to be considered as an IOT device
							it will have to satisfy at least one of the following three criteria. The first; the device
							must have networking capability whereby it will be able speak to another device and exchange
							information. This could be a connection through Wi-Fi, remote cloud, or a local server. The
							second; the device must be able to sense something in its environment. For example, it could
							sense whether a door has been opened, a person has entered the room or simply the absence of
							either. The third: the device would be able to actuate something. So, when they are
							triggered, the lights may turn on, the tv turned off or doors locked. These three criteria
							are the defining characteristics of an IOT device (Shovic 2016, p. 1 -2). </p>
						<p>So, what are small computing devices? They are a small(generally fit into a human hand) sized
							computer that can be programmed to do whatever its programmer can imagine and develop it to
							be. The capability of these devices varies. Some are severely basic and only capable of
							basic functions like on/off capability. And others are small personal computers with a built
							in Operating System which run just like a normal computer. They can handle mouse and
							keyboard input, stream movies and pretty much anything else a normal computer can
							do. </p>
						<p>Raspberry Pi&rsquo;s are one of the most popular small computing devices on the market. They
							cost $35US and have USB3 ports, CPU, HDMI outputs and your choice of RAM size. 2GB, 4GB or
							8GB. They also have 4k video capability. Sound familiar? Yes, they are just like a normal
							desktop computer only tinier and considerably cheaper. They also include a Linux based
							Operating System. Sales for these computers hit 640,000 units in March 2020 alone. This peak
							in sales has been attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent lockdowns, as people
							have been using these devices as cheap and efficient way of working and learning from home,
							as well as use in home IOT projects (Tung 2020). </p>
						<p>Arduinos and Makey Makeys are two other types of small computing device on the market right
							now. Arduinos are small open-source circuit boards which developers can use to create
							projects and IOT devices. They are known as a micro controller. They are more simplistic in
							comparison to the Raspberry Pi, in that they do not have built in Operating systems and will
							not function like a normal computer. But they can interact with devices around them or send
							information to your computer for analysis or storage. Some Arduinos even have Wi-Fi chips
							installed so they can interact directly with the cloud. This can make the information
							accessible to computers or mobile devices anywhere in the world. That is pretty handy for
							application development. </p>
						<p>Makey Makeys are an education based micro controller. They are simpler in design and
							functionality. And marketed, and often used, for classroom situations. They come with easy
							attachable alligator clips and how to books and video for getting started. These small
							devices are a great learning projects for children. </p>
						<p>The potential impact of these developments will be most felt by the owner of which ever
							device is chosen. As these products are essentially a blank canvas in which a person can
							develop their own modern convenience, the level of impact is relative to the capability of
							the creation. However, this is the direct impact of these devices. The more popular they
							become and more their use becomes part of the general knowledge of society, we should see a
							rise in these devices use and their capability. </p>
						<p>As the Raspberry Pi is so affordable and widely available it has become the brains of many
							inventions in recent years. A Robotics Engineer from California has recently created a
							ventilator machine using the Raspberry Pi in response to the Covid-19 pandemic. As these
							machines are in high demand as a treatment for suffering patients. Creations like this will
							the future of these products. Engineered and designed to fill gaps in the market. Or to
							create solutions to problems faced by the individual or the general population. </p>
						<p>How will this affect me? At this moment I do not own any of these devices, and their
							existence is something that I have only recently become familiar with. But they are
							something I will keep in mind next time a problem arises that I need to find a solution for
							through use of technology. To have these devices readily available and most importantly
							affordable gives me the chance to try out and to develop these ideas and tailor them to my
							own individual needs. And it is also possible that any IOT products available of the shelf
							that I may purchase in the future could use these technologies or have been originally
							developed with one of these technologies. </p>
						<p>In the age of the Internet of Things these devices will pave the way to educate and enlighten
							the general population of the wonders of technology. These small devices have in a sense
							already replaced their larger and more expensive older siblings known as laptops and
							computer towers, as the Raspberry Pi 4 demonstrates. While they do not have near the same
							processing power as a top-of-the-line Laptop right now, if they continue their innovation,
							they may do in the future. </p>

						<h2><a name="_Toc69739725"></a>Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies</h2>
						<p>By Marc Valpiani</p>

						<p><b>What does it do? What is the state of the art of this new technology? What can be done now?
							What is likely to be able to do be done soon (say in the next 3 years)?
							What technological or other developments make this possible?</b></p>

						<p>Blockchain and cryptocurrency are two separate, yet closely related technologies,
							as blockchain provides the technical foundation for cryptocurrency. Blockchain is a technology that allows
							for the creation of universal, distributed and decentralised ledgers, a ledger being the record of all the
							transactions that an organisation has completed (Iansiti and Lakhani, 2017). </p>

						<p>As suggested by the name, a &lsquo;blockchain&rsquo; is conceptualised as being a series of &lsquo;blocks&rsquo; that exist on a &lsquo;chain&rsquo;.
							Each record or entry in a ledger is stored in a block, with these blocks being linked together to form a chain.
							Each block stores the hash (a unique identifier) of the previous block, creating a link between a block and all previous blocks,
							explaining its conceptualisation as a chain. The significance of this linking of blocks is that if a person attempts to change
							a record on a block, the fact that they are linked means that they would have to change all blocks, significantly increasing the security of the ledger. </p>

						<p>A significant difference between a blockchain and a traditional ledger is that blockchains are <i>distributed</i>,
							meaning that copies of the entire ledger are stored by each party involved and no single party owns and controls the ledger.
							This differs from traditional ledgers which are generally stored and maintained by a central authority.
							The distributed nature of blockchains makes them more secure than traditional legers as copies of the same record are stored
							on all nodes of the network and if there are any discrepancies between records they can be reconciled by all nodes forming a consensus.</p>

						<p>Another interesting aspect of blockchain’s decentralised nature is that transactions are done <i>peer to peer</i> rather than through a centralised database.
							These transactions are recorded to the blockchain through the two nodes involved storing and sending updated records to all other nodes in the network.</p>

						<p><i>Trust Gap</i></p>

						<p>In his popular TED talk, Fortune 500 executive and angel investor Richie Etwaru discusses the transformative potential of blockchain
							to solve the &lsquo;trust gap&rsquo; (Etwaru, 2017). He argues that trust is vital to commerce and is the foundation of people’s ability to transact
							with one and other. The current state of business is that parties to a transaction default to not trusting the other, with trust being
							partially being established by intermediaries such as motor vehicle authorities (an intermediary that allows people to verify each other’s
							identities) or a land and title office that maintains records on the changes of ownership of a house or piece of land. </p>

						<p>The current way of conducting business and record keeping has a number of flaws that can be addressed using blockchain technology.
							Firstly, complete trust in a ledger cannot be established as it is possible for malicious actors to edit or falsify records.
							Secondly, a layer of intermediaries to each transaction creates friction by creating extra costs and delays, as multiple records must be accessed,
							updated and reconciled. In another popular TEDx video Chief Digital Officer of the Mahindra Group,
							Jaspreet Bindra uses the example of foreign currency transfers that often involve lengthy delays and high fees (Bindra, 2018).</p>

						<p><i>What will be able to be done</i></p>

						<p>Blockchain has the potential to revolutionise a number of industries, in his talk <i>How Blockchain can transform India</i>
							Bindra discusses two potential use cases for blockchain technology. The first is its potential to transform agriculture in India,
							by allowing farmers to pool their resources and manage shared ownership of land and expensive agricultural equipment.
							The second use case is using blockchain technology to manage peer to peer power networks in rural villages that do not have access to centralised power grids.
							Using a combination of internet of things sensors and blockchain technology, village members who have excess solar power may sell
							their excess power to those who do not own their own solar panels (Bindra, 2018). </p>

						<p>In <i>Blockchain: Massively Simplified</i> Richie Etwaru discusses the use of blockchain ledgers in relation to consumer products,
							such as fresh produce in supermarkets. Etwaru discussed the idea of using blockchain to verify whether a grapefruit was organic
							or was just simply falsely labelled as such. In this scenario, a consumer would be able to scan a QR code to access the blockchain
							containing the record of its supply chain (Etwaru, 2017). </p>

						<p>Another application of blockchain technology will be the use of cryptocurrencies to exchange value without a bank or other financial
							institution to act as an intermediary. This has the potential to significantly impact global commerce by allowing unbanked individuals
							to conduct electronic transactions if they have access to a mobile device and the internet. The significance of this impact is
							highlighted by a World Bank estimate that 1.7 billion adults remain unbanked, yet two thirds of this number have access to a mobile
							device that may be used for payments (World Bank, 2018, para.7). </p>

						<p><i>What other developments have made this possible</i></p>

						<p>Due to its significant computing requirements, advancements in blockchain technology have relied on the development of advanced
							Graphical Processing Units (GPUs) and a reliable and abundant supply of electricity.</p>

						<p><b>What is the likely impact? (300 words) What is the potential impact of this development? What is likely to change? Which people
							will be most affected and how? Will this create, replace or make redundant any current jobs or technologies?</b></p>

						<p>Aside from the impacts discussed in the above section, some other potentially significant impacts of this technology are its ability to disrupt
							intermediary institutions and its potentially serious environmental impact due to the technology’s substantial power requirements.</p>

						<p>If the claims of blockchains transformative potential are true, a number of currently common jobs will be made redundant. For example,
							a widespread adoption of cryptocurrencies may drastically reduce the need for foreign currency exchanges. While it may be possible that
							blockchain creates a number of new unheard of jobs, it seems unlikely that the number of jobs gained would outnumber those lost to the disruption (CBInsights, 2021). </p>

						<p>An unintended, yet significant impact of this technology is its environmental impact. Due to its computational intensity,
							cryptocurrency mining consumes an enormous amount of power, with the BBC estimating that bitcoin mining ‘uses a similar amount
							of power as the Netherlands’ (Rowlatt, 2021, para.10). For this reason, an unfortunate side effect of cryptocurrencies and
							maintaining blockchains would be accelerating climate change. This flaw will need to be addressed, lest the technology cause serious unintended harms.</p>

						<p>Another unintended impact is the creation of shortages of specific computer hardware that is used in cryptocurrency mining such
							as powerful Graphical Processing Units (GPUs) that are needed in high-end gaming computers. To address this impact,
							the manufacturer Nvidia has built in features that decrease the performance of their GPUs if it detects that it is
							being used for crypto currency mining (British Broadcasting Corporation, 2021).</p>

						<p><b>How will this affect you? (300 words) In your daily life, how will this affect you?
						What will be different for you? How might this affect members of your family or your friends?</b></p>

						<p>Anecdotally it seems as though it will be some time before blockchain technology has a significant impact on my daily life.
							However, If my daily life were to be affected by blockchain technology in the near term it would be as a result of opting-in to
							certain technologies, examples of which include the Brave web browser and using cryptocurrency to buy items over the internet. </p>

						<p>Switching to a blockchain based web browser such as Brave has the potential to impact the day to day life of my friends and family
							by allowing them to browse the internet at higher speeds and with greater privacy.</p>

						<p>As the world reopens to international travel, it may be feasible to travel and purchase items using cryptocurrency.
							This will reduce the need for exchanging money into multiple currencies, with often unfavourable exchange rates.</p>

						<p>Through researching the likely impacts of blockchain technology, it seems as though the impacts of the technology on daily life
							will be much larger in developing countries than developed nations. In Australia, faith in institutions such as banks and the
							political process is arguably higher than in developing nations. For example, the introduction of cryptocurrency payments in
							Australian stores might be an interesting novelty, although it is fairly safe to assume that almost all Australian adults have
							bank accounts so paying for goods and services with a credit or debit card is not radically different to using bitcoin. Whereas
							for someone in a developing country without a bank account, cryptocurrency has the power to significantly improve their lives. </p>

						<p>One area where blockchain may make a significant difference to my life is in the field of consumer decision making. Blockchain may
							change my buying behavior and that of my friends and family, by granting a greater insight into the production process and supply chains
							of various items, leading to purchasing different brands or types of product. </p>

						<p>Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that involves processing large amounts of data to make predictions
							or glean insights from that data set. IBM describes machine learning as being &lsquo;applications that learn from data and improve
							their accuracy over time without being programmed to do so&rsquo; (IBM, 2020, para. 1). A more simple definition from Google developer
							advocate Yufeng Guo is that Machine Learning is ‘using data to answer questions’ (Guo, 2017).</p>

						<p>To summarise a number of descriptions of the technology, it could be said that machine learning gives machines the power to act
							in human-like ways, in that machines are increasingly able to interpret information and generate novel decisions and recommendations.
							For example, machine learning gives machines the ability to &lsquo;see&rsquo; (computer vision), in that they can take in visual inputs and
							recognise distinct objects. Machine learning can also give machines the ability to &lsquo;hear&rsquo; by processing and interpreting human speech.</p>

						<p>One &lsquo;state of the art&rsquo; application of machine learning is image recognition, a capability that is used in fields ranging from autonomous
							vehicles to medicine. Autonomous vehicles are able to &lsquo;see&rsquo; through a process known as computer vision, a sub-field of machine learning.
							Machine learning techniques such as the use of convolutional neural networks are used to ‘train’ the algorithm to recognise certain
							images such as pedestrians and traffic lights (Lai, 2018, para. 8). From being trained to recognise these images, machines are trained
							how to act based on what they see, much like a person would be when they learn how to drive.  </p>

						<p>Another cutting edge application of machine learning is training computers to recognise malignant melanomas.
							Through a deep learning neural network known as DERM (Deep Ensemble for Recognition of Melanoma), computers
							can be trained to recognise malignant melanoma at a level of success that is recommended to be used as a decision support
							tool in primary care (Phillips et.al, 2019). </p>

						<p>Machine learning powers much of the personalisation that users encounter in applications and on the web.
							Popular platforms such as Netflix, Spotify and YouTube use machine learning to recommend videos that
							are most relevant to you. An example of this is Spotify’s &lsquo;Discover Weekly&rsquo; playlist which utilises machine
							learning techniques to create a personalised playlist of new music for you to discover each week. Spotify achieves
							this by using techniques such as NLP (Natural Language Processing) to scrape articles to extract information about
							certain artists and recommend related artists (Harvard Business School, 2018). It is also investing heavily in
							its audio analysis engine that can more deeply analyse audio files to recommend meaningfully related music.</p>

						<p><i>What will be able to be done soon? Near term capabilities of machine learning</i></p>

						<p>It can be expected that in the next three years that machine learning will advance incrementally, but it seems unlikely
							that there will be any ground breaking progress in the field. This assumption is based on the Gartner hype cycle assessment
							that as of 2020, machine learning had passed the &lsquo;peak of inflated expectations&rsquo; and was on the downward trend towards
							the &lsquo;trough of disillusionment&rsquo; and that it was expected to remain there for the next two to five years (Goasduff, 2020).
							From this assessment it is reasonable to expect some incremental improvement in machine learning capability. </p>

						<p><i>Developments that enable machine learning</i></p>

						<p>Developments in machine learning have been powered by continual advancement in processing power, the growth in the size of data sets and the
							development of specialised machine learning hardware such as Google’s tensor processing unit. </p>

						<p><b>What is the likely impact? (300 words) What is the potential impact of this development? What
							is likely to change? Which people will be most affected and how? Will this create, replace
							or make redundant any current jobs or technologies?</b></p>

						<p>A likely impact of machine learning is a significant increase in economic productivity in tandem with a disruption to the labour market.
							Machine learning will allow an increasing number of tasks to be automated, allowing for greater economic output for the same labour input.
							It is currently unknown how much of an impact machine learning and artificial intelligence will have on the labour market, as it is unclear
							to what extent machine learning will enable machines to perform better than humans on general tasks. </p>

						<p>Current machine learning capability has progressed to the point to which machines can outperform the leading human experts in narrow domains that have clear rules.
							An example of this is <i>Deep Blue</i> beating Kasparov in chess and <i>AlphaGo</i> beating the best human player. Furthermore,
							the types of tasks that machines are able to outperform humans in is increasing in complexity, moving from Chess to Go and on to games like Starcraft. </p>

						<p>Extrapolating this trend into the future, it may be possible that machines may outperform humans at all tasks, at which point it could be possible that all
							human workers could be replaced by machines. However this view fails to take into account the fact that there are some jobs that machines are
							entirely unsuited to and involve traits such as empathy and creativity such as conducting therapy. Other jobs that machines would be
							unsuitable for are ones that human touch and manual dexterity are required, for example a masseuse.</p>

						<p>In his article <i>Machine learning will redesign, not replace, work</i>, Tom Reilhan from <i>MIT’s Sloan School of Management</i> argues that a more likely outcome
							of the growth of machine learning is that human workers are likely to be augmented by the technology rather than be replaced by it. He argues that
							every job can be thought of as a collection of tasks and that machines will be able to take over tasks in which they have the advantage over humans
							and that humans can perform the tasks that they have the advantage in (Reilhan, 2018). An example of this would be a Radiologist, machine learning
							has now been developed to a point that it is better at recognising and classifying skin cancers than human experts. However, medicine involves
							communicating with patients, a task that humans are obviously more well suited to.</p>


						<p><b>How will this affect you? (300 words) In your daily life, how will this affect you? What will
							be different for you? How might this affect members of your family or your friends?</b></p>

						<p>The effects of machine learning on everyday life are pervasive yet surprisingly subtle. An obvious example of machine learning's impact on daily life
							is its extensive use in popular &lsquo;on-demand&rsquo; entertainment services. Companies such as Spotify, Netflix and YouTube utilise sophisticated Machine
							Learning algorithms that learn your preferences as you engage with the platform (Harvard Business School, 2018). These algorithms then guide you
							towards the content that is most likely to keep you engaged, in an effort to increase your time using their product (Netflix, 2021).  </p>

						<p>Anecdotally I have found the effect of these algorithms to be beneficial yet simultaneously quite limiting. While they improve the user experience
							by serving relevant and personalised content, one major drawback of these algorithms is that they seem to be self-reinforcing.
							The algorithm learns your preferences and shows you content that you are likely to engage with, presenting it in clearly visible
							parts of the platform, in turn making it more likely that you will engage with that new, similar content. This will then cause
							the algorithm to show you more of that similar content, restarting this self fulfilling cycle until the range of content becomes
							increasingly narrow, making it harder to find exciting or radically different content that may be out of your comfort zone.</p>

						<p>Not only are machine learning algorithms shaping the types of content that you see, they are also being used to shape the content itself.
							An example of this is how Netflix uses viewer data to inform the writing of its shows. Netflix uses predictive models to understand
							how viewers will react if a particular thing happens in a show. The company uses these insights to particular writing decisions that
							are likely to make shows more suitable for &lsquo;binge-watching&rsquo;. The impact of this process on daily life is the impression that content
							generated by these data driven streaming companies appears to be eerily formulaic and generic (Hurley, 2018).</p>

						<p>A more pernicious effect of machine learning algorithms on the daily lives of users is their effect on the dissemination of news content
							and the creation of &lsquo;filter bubbles&rsquo;. In his article <i>Algorithmic catastrophe: How news feeds reprogram your mind and habits</i>,
							Eli Pariser, an affiliate of the Safra centre for ethics at Harvard university argues that algorithmic news feeds create &lsquo;filter bubbles&rsquo;
							by failing to show users articles that they may disagree with. He described the effect of this as creating &lsquo;a personal universe of information
							that’s been generated by algorithms that are trying to guess what you’re interested in&rsquo; (Pariser, 2018).</p>

						<p>These &lsquo;filter bubbles&rsquo; have the potential to radically alter a person’s everyday experience by reshaping their world view,
							which would in turn influence how they think, feel and act. This effect has been theorised as leading to political
							polarisation and the rise of populist and reactionary political movements. This effect is an unfortunate byproduct
							of the attention economy, a model which seeks to increase users' time on site, with many other concerns taking a back
							seat to the demands of advertisers.  </p>

         					<h4><a name="_Toc69739723"></a>Project Planning Summary </h4>
						
						
						<p>In order to sufficiently aim for the completion of the project within the limited timeframe, it is essential for all members of the Chatbots Team to set project milestones and deliverables illustrating the project breakdowns creating a manageable plan that we can all adhere to throughout the project. However, it is expected that not all steps of the project will be adhered throughout the process, everyone member of our group will illustrate their project schedule and progress through a Gantt chart through the Team Planner app of Microsoft teams.  </p>

						<h6>Week 1 (April 17th-april 23rd) </h6>
						<p>Week 1 is the planning stage. To make a prototype, of something as complex as a chatbot can be, we must first investigate to ascertain what may be possible and realistic in this project. And then start to investigate how we could proceed to the building and testing phase. </p>
						<p> After researching(‘googling’) some chatbots that are already out there. And looking for potential services that could assist in creating something marketable. </p>
						<p>The research brought two likely candidates for a prototype. The first being Microsoft Azure (they offer a free trial for testing and development), and Discord (free API calls up to 1,000 per day). Both are claiming to have an easy to build chat bot framework. So, the investigation led first with these two.</p>
						<h6>Week 2 (April 24th- April 30th)</h6>
						<p>After some more research, Discord proved to be too limited for the uses of this project. The bot framework they support is to easily create a bot within a discord server. The framework they created is a coding package for use in NodeJS and Python which makes it easy to create some basic bot logic then send it directly to Discord server where it will be rendered in your Discord channel. So, in other terms it is a bot that can only be used while using discord. This does not suit us as we require a bot that can be exported and used outside of this environment. With Microsoft Azure left we continued to investigate this as a possibility.</p>
						<h6>Week 3 (May 1st – May 7th)</h6>
						<p>Exploring Microsoft Azure </p>
						<p>After some more investigation Microsoft Azure offers something called a cognitive service. And this can be used to create “chatty” QnA Bot. Through reading the documentation of this service, I began to create a QnA Bot.</p>
						<p>This process was tedious. The Microsoft Azure platform is neither intuitive nor user friendly. But with the help of the supporting documentation, I could create a “Knowledge Base”. This forms the basis of the QnA function. The platform will accept FAQ URLs from websites. So, you simply pass the URL into the field where it is required, and their system reads the webpage to procure the Questions and answers. After feeding the knowledge base some FAQ pages on Covid-19. You “publish” the knowledge base then Azure has provided a chat window to test and interact with the bot. Success! It works. </p>
						<p>But this chat window exists only the Microsoft Azure platform. The question then becomes how to produce a product from this. But the answer comes quite simply in the form of an API supplied by Microsoft. At this point it becomes clear that in order to create a running prototype we will need to use code to create one using the API that Microsoft provide. I have some experience in developing programs with JavaScript. So, I begin working on the App.</p>
						<p>The idea originally was to create a front facing application for the chat bot using the Microsoft API to interact with the knowledge base to get answers from the users’ questions, then render this on a chat window using JavaScript. The Microsoft API requires a key for authentication, which I assumed could be hidden using the GitHub environment secrets so we could incorporate the chat bot on the GitHub pages assignment website. </p>
						<p>But after completing a functioning prototype this way, I discovered that these environment variables do not function as I assumed. These environment variables are for use in the GitHub Actions API and are not for use GitHub Pages Applications. In fact, all GitHub pages does is serve static HTML and all scripts and style sheets linked to it. So, there would be no way to keep my API key safe from prying eyes while using only a front facing application. What I would have to do is program a server to do the API call and leave the front end the job of dynamically rendering the HTML questions and answers from our user and the Bot response. </p>
						 <h2><a name="_Toc69739723"></a>Node JS</h2>
						<h6>>Week 4 (May 8th – May 14th) </h6>
						
						<p>During Week 3 I began to create the Server using NodeJS with Express as a framework. The process is quite simple using Express. The process was quite swift. To call the Microsoft API I used AXIOS. This is a promise-based API library that makes API calls simpler. After creating the server, a new workflow is created. The user will type a message using the chat window, hit Send, the front-end JavaScript then renders the question on the screen and passes the question to the back end using AXIOS. Once received by the Backend the Microsoft API is called, again using AXIOS. Using the, now secured, API key and the response is delivered back to the front end for rendering in the Chat Window. If an error occurs this is caught but no message is delivered to the user informing them of this. This is a feature that could be added in future development. </p>
						<p>Once this process is completed, I use the time to style window and add the chat bubbles using CSS. And make the application appear more professional and pleasing to the eye. But from the next issue is lurking. Because after all this work I have nowhere to host it so it can be seen by users, investors, or assessment graders. From here I decide to host it using Heroku. Its free, easy to use and fits the purposes of this assessment. </p>
						<p>The process of having a project hosted by Heroku is normally easy. But in this case, it did not go to plan. The idea is you create an app on your profile, then you receive a GitHub URL from Heroku to set up as a remote Repo. Then push the exiting code to this URL. Then it should be visible on your app’s website. This did not work. I received lots of errors. Without knowing the source of the error, I consulted goggle for answers. But none came. So, it was decided that there must be something fundamentally wrong with my program’s server even though everything worked perfectly in a development environment. I downloaded a Heroku template for NodeJS and adapted my program into this template. But still the error persisted. After some research, no answer came. </p>
						<p>But then I discovered it in the build logs. These are logs of the build process Heroku provides for bug hunting. I had stored my API key in a variable for use in the development environment in a Js file. But this variable did not exist in a production environment and every time the build program was run it would be blocked looking for this environment variable. After fixing this, everything worked as planned, the panic receded and I was finally able to share the finished product with my teammates.</p>
						
						<h6>Week 5  (May-15th – May 21st)</6>
						<p>Week 4 has been primarily used as report writing week. All our efforts so far must be put into report form for assessment.</p>

						<h6>Overall Plan: Develop a Chatbot Service capable of answering questions regarding the Covid 19 virus.)</h6>
						<p>Planning Stage: Investigate AIs, Machine Learning, etc. Companies that can provide a service. What, how? </p>
						<h6>Notes from my daily log (01/05/21 approx. 4 hrs.):</h6>
						<p>Today's Plan: Investigate possible alternative AIs Chatbots with other providers (Amazon qnabot):</p>
						<ul>
							<li>amazon.com/qnabot. Just as difficult, we are unlikely to be able to build a chatbot in Java, too many complexities. </li>
							<li>We would need to hire a specialist to help us get the basics operational. </li>
							<li>Unable to get a basic chatbot service running.</li>
							<li>Requires more in-depth knowledge of Java and the associated packages. Maven, plugin ab.jar. </li>
						</ul>
						<h6>Notes from my daily log (02/05/21 approx. 2 hrs.):</h6>
						<p>Today's Plan: Continue Investigating possible alternative Java Webservice to communicate with the MS Azure Chatbot.</p>
						<ul> 
							<li>There are many already built medical diagnosis Chatbots out in the market. Not sure why we are doing this?</li>
							<li>I am seeing a lot of medical Chatbots out in the market. Some of these are good, they diagnose using a variety of mobile phone tools, photos, heart rate monitors, very impressive technology. To tell you the truth I had become convinced that such technologies were fads surely to fade out, but now not so sure. 	</li>
							<li>Hoping Justin H, has something running in JavaScript. That might be easier. </li>
							<li>Chatbots, Machine Learning, etc. I think is outside of our scope of understanding at this point in our studies. </li>
					
							
						</ul>
						<h6>Notes from my daily log (04/05/21 approx. 2-3 hrs.):</h6>
						<p>Today's Plan: Investigate using Discord as a front end Webservice platform to communicate with the MS Azure Chatbot.</p>
			<p>Simply put, an endpoint is one end of a communication channel. When an API interacts with another system, the touchpoints of this communication are considered endpoints. For APIs (Application Programming Interfaces), an endpoint can include a URL of a server or service. The place that APIs send requests and where the resource lives, is called an endpoint. </p>
			<p>Need an endpoint API service to act as the initial starting point for the chatbot. We can then enable multiple or one chatbot services, but also have the flexibility to switch. This would enable different FAQs for each customer depending on what they wanted.</p>
			<p>Discord for running our service is not what we are looking for. This service is more of a toy than a commercial web application service. The tools here do not suit our purposes. We need to deploy our own Endpoint on GitHub.
At this point I started writing a specification document. File Location: MS Teams > Teams > Documents > General > Spec AI ChatBotCovid19
</p>
			<h6>Notes from my daily log (18/05/21 approx. 6 hrs.): </h6>
			<p>Today's Plan: Get the Java Webservice communicating with the MS Azure Chatbot. </p>
			<ul>
				<li>Success! Well, I have a Java Console driven program that can talk to the MS Azure QnA cognitive bot service. </li>
				<li>Turns out once I explored another avenue, it was easy than I expected. Microsoft's tutorials were a distraction I could have done without. All I have wanted to achieve was to send a https POST request to the service and be able to interpret the response. However, Microsoft's tutorials do not really cover this. They seem to be more about their own Software. 	 </li>
				<li>I explored the postman.com website. Once I got the POST request configured here; I was better able to diagnose what was wrong. A few tweaks to the header parameters and I was away. Unfortunately, not having thought of this sooner, I have not left myself with enough time to explore building a fully deployable service on GitHub. This is only a Java Console routine working within Eclipse, I am damn happy I got to here. I needed a week away to reset and start again a fresh. </li>
				<li>I did not detail this in my daily log. However, I created a second knowledge base within my Azure account. Called Australian Government FAQ on Covid 19. </li>
				<li>I changed it to use the following FAQs URLs. It also uses a Professional language response interpreter. </li>

							<h2>PROTOTYPE 3 – DIALOGFLOW </h2>
							
						</header>
         					<h4><a name="_Toc69739723"></a>Project Planning Summary </h4>
						
						
						
		<p align = "center" ><img src="images/dialogflow1.jpg" alt="" width="" height="" class="floatright"/></p>			
            <p>By Alice W Lin and Reane Nadina Sutoyo/p>
           
						<h6>PROJECT PREPARATION</h6>
						<h6>Week 1 (April 17th-april 23rd)</h6>
						
						<p>This week, the bulk of our time will be spent getting everything in order and setting up the tracking system to manage all of our project features. This includes  "Todo list," "In progress," "Ready for testing," "In testing," "Unit Tested," "Completed" that will make using an excel page. Each is tagged with its respective platform, working on it, and when it is expected to be completed. Additionally, we are also using a Microsoft OneDrive to store progress, resources, and other assets and documents. To better coordinate our activities, we have set up an Excel spreadsheet and are using Microsoft Teams to coordinate our team's activities.</p>
						 
						<h6>Week 2 (April 24th- April 30th)</h6>
						<p>Areas explored this week: </p>
						<ul>
							<li>platform research and comparison</li>
							<li>Dialogflow research</li>
							<li>Exploring Dialogflow console</li>
							
						</ul>
						
						<h6>PLATFORM RESEARCH & COMPARISON</h6>
						<p>We discussed and covered some of the most common AIML (Artificial Intelligence Markup Language) modeling systems. This includes Dialogflow, a chatbot available on Google's Cloud, Discord, Microsoft Azure, and Lex by AWS Chatbot.</p>
						<p></p>
						<ul>
							<li>API.ai  (it’s inituitive interface and the most popular among developers and companies.)</li>
							<li>WIT.ai</li>
							<li>Motion.ai</li>
							<li>OnSequel</li>
							<li>Chatfuel</li>
							<li>Botsify</li>
							<li>ManyChat</li>
						</ul>
							
						<h6>What can I do with Chatbots?</h6>
						<ul>
							<li>Get customized notifications and news.</li>
							<li>A bot can act as a smart newspaper, sending you a relevant content as soon as it’s published.</li>
							<li>Integrate with other services</li>
							<li>A bot can enrich website with contents from external services like IMD, Wiki, Youtube, GitHub, Foursquare</li>
							<li>Create custom tools</li>
							<li>Build single and multiplayer games</li>
							<li>A bot can play chess and checkers against you, act as host in quiz games or even take up the dungeon master’s dice for an RPG</li>
							<li>Build Social Services</li>
							<li>A bot could connect with people looking for conversation partners based on common interest or proximity.</li>
								
						</uL>
						
						<h6>We took into account the following factors when deciding on some of the best platforms:</h6>
						<ul>
							<li>Easy integration to a variety of platforms such as website's web chat service, potentially Facebook and other social media platforms, IoTs like Alexa by amazon, Cortana, and google assistant</li>
							<li>Easy usage without too much coding</li>
							<li>The backend cloud computing is reliable and scalable</li>
							<li>Functional requirements such as allowing users to register on the application and saving their details to our database. They can re-visit their account/data again or continue their diagnosis. </li>
							<li>The chatbot should be relatively fast and should not take more than 5 seconds to respond to user questions</li>
							<li>The software is protected from faults or bugs </li>
							<li>Comply with data protect acts and is secure in terms of end-user data as well as programmer data.  </li>
							
						</ul>
						<h6>DIALOGFLOW RESEARCH & INSIGHTS</h6>
						<p>Dialogflow, a Google-owned chatbot development platform that enables developers to develop audio and conversational chatbots to respond to user questions in multiple languages automatically, was another platform we explored. Some of the positive aspects that we found are the flexibility where Dialogflow allows our chatbots to be integrated into a large variety of media, its support on multiple types of devices, such as wearables, to phones, computers, and also the multi-language support, with more than 14+ languages available worldwide.  </p>
						<p>Alice and Reane have decided to test out this platform as a subgroup. /p>
						<h6>EXPLORING THE CONSOLE & HOW IT WORKS</h6>
						<ul>
							<ol>We signed up to Dialogflow and created a new agent at console.dialogflow.com.</ol>
							<ol>Enabled all Permissions asked by Google Cloud Console to let us have access to the Dialogflow console. We started playing around with the system, followed mainly guides on google Dialogflow </ol>
							<ol>Below is the interface of Dialogflow, that we learnt how to use from the official google page, it was important for us to fully understand all the functions within the module to maximise our final prototype, we are able to manage everything needed to create this chatbot.</ol>
						</ul>
						<p>The design of the Dialogflow Console (above) is extremely straight forward and clean which we absolutely loved, very easy to use. Here is the explanation of all the key elements to build out chatbot, something very important for us to understand in order to produce a fully functional prototype:</p>
						<li><strong>Agents :</strong> Our NLU (Natural Language Understanding) chatbot which we can give a name to</li>
						<li><strong>Intents :</strong> Here we use intents to categorize a user’s intentions, where it have training phrases, example might be the end-user ask our chatbot “Who are you?, “What is your name?” or “do you have a name?” these questions are different yet they have the same intension: to get the name of the Chatbot. </li>
						<li><strong>Entities :</strong> unlike intent entities used when end-user ask very specific information, like specific names, or addresses, or the number of units etc. The awesome thing about Dialogue flow is that there 3 types of entities, one of which is called system entities where it is already preloaded with numerous system entities, which allows our agent to extract existing information without having us to load them in ourselves, for example this would include like the current time or date, and location etc. The other two types of entities are called developer and session entities, which is when you need to develop your own entities, and entities that only apply to specific situations like booking a reservation for the end user. </li>
						<li>Knowledge(Beta):This is something new that the V2 of Dialogflow introduced, where you can parse knowledge documents, for example FAQs, or Articles to find automated responses. The only limitation however, currently this is only available in English. This I think is extremely handy, since our chatbot is mainly currently FAQ based</li>
						<li><strong>Fulfillment:</strong> By default, our chatbot responds to a matched intent with a static response, however if you want to advance your chatbot, which is something we are hoping we would have time to get into, this is a “logic” or “smart” code that excutes when an intent is matched, our chatbot would then be able to perform an action or return a dynamic response by sending a webhook request to an external APIs and databases.  This part is of cos more complicated, however if time allowed, we would give it a go.</li>
